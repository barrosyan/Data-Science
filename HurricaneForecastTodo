#Next step is to code the Physics equations that describes the movement (Flow mechanics with a different analysis);
#Then, we load the satellite data and make a reanalysis;
#After, we have to load the statistical data;
#Then, we build and feed our Neural Network model;
#Plot the visualization and compare the results;
